It is just the same game as GCSO_Simulator just the difference is here the car is changed with a bullet with different thicknesses and the wall now has different thicknesses. In this game we check the reliability of walls with different bullets. If the damage is greater than 10, then the wall is not effective against the bullet. If the damage is lesser than 10, then the wall is effective against the bullet. *You have to refresh the page to see different differenet results.
